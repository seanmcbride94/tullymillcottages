                        This is commonly referred to as profiling and it is our way of providing you with a more bespoke customer experience based on how we

                    <p class="black"><i>We collect your personal data from several sources, including directly from you, which we then combine in order 
                        to create a view of your interactions with our group of companies. Once we have this record, we match multiple variables that are 
                        unique to you (such as name, email, postcode and/or mobile number) to create an overall matched record. We then clean the record by 
                        comparing it with certain third-party reference files (such as the Post Office Address File, the Bereavement Register and email validation) 
                        to try to ensure that the record is as accurate as possible.</i></p>
                    <p class="black"><i>Once the record is cleaned, we add the record to our customer database and we start to build a behavioural profile about 
                        you, which details the brands that you do, or do not, engage with. We also infer a visit to a particular brand location so that we can 
                        gain a better understanding of how far you might travel to visit a particular brand of ours. In addition, we apply our algorithms or 
                        scoring models to the record to indicate how likely it will be that you will visit a particular brand in the future. We then segment our 
                        overall database to create a customer base for each brand to determine those customers with a high likelihood to visit a brand and those 
                        who are unlikely to visit a brand. Your record may be in more than one segmented element of the database, for example, you may be high 
                        likelihood for 3 of our brands and low likelihood for 2 of our brands within your catchment area.</i></p> 
                    <p class="black"><i>As well as looking at how you interact with our brands, we also apply demographic profiles (provided to us by a third party 
                        supplier of demographic data) to your record using your postcode. These profiles are trends based on a nationally representative sample. 
                        This enables us to understand your likely profile such as age, home and financial situation as well as your attitudes to family, home life, 
                        matters such as dining, media consumption or your purchasing behaviour.</i></p>
                    <p class="black"><i>Finally, to ensure that you get the most relevant communications from us, we may use the above variables (if you have 
                        agreed to us sending you certain communications) to select an appropriate communication for you to receive, as well as ensuring the you 
                        receive the right content or offer. For example, our profiling will help us determine whether you may be more interested in a family message 
                        and offer as opposed to a champagne promotion. We enhance this information with data we have regarding the communications and promotions that 
                        you have (or have not) engaged with in the past.</i></p>
                    <h5><b>Significance and Consequence of the Profiling</b></h5>
                    <p class="black"><i>The profiling we do enables us to better understand how you interact, or may interact, with our brands. It enables us to 
                        provide you with the most relevant information (such as vouchers and offers where you have agreed to receive these) and to determine whether 
                        a particular brand or outlet should be more tailored to those people who do, or who are likely to, visit it. The profiling also helps us to 
                        improve our services and the offerings of our brands depending on the demographic of existing or future visitors.</i></p>

                        including where we share your information with our suppliers and partners, to protect your personal data from being accidentally lost, 
                        used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. We have also put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data 
                        breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

                    <p class="black">We can only keep your personal data for as long as necessary for the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes 
                        of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
                    <p class="black">The precise length of time we hold your personal data for varies depending on the individual circumstances, but in 
                        determining the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the 
                        potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and 
                        whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p> 
                    <p class="black">We regularly review our retention periods to ensure that we are not keeping your data for longer than necessary. Details of 
                        retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available by contacting us.</p>

                    <p class="black">In certain circumstances, you may have the right to request access, transfer, rectification and/or erasure of the personal 
                        data that we process about you. You may also have the right to object to and/or restrict our processing of your personal data. Details 
                        of the rights are set out below.</p>
                    <p class="black">- <b>Human intervention:</b> you may request human intervention where a decision has been made about you based solely on automated 
                        processing, and/or you may challenge that decision (this may happen in the context of our recruitment process where we collect information 
                        relating to whether or not a candidate has unspent criminal convictions).</p> 
                     <p class="black">- <b>Access:</b> you may request access to your personal data, which enables you to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold 
                        about you and to check to see if we are processing it lawfully.</p> 
                     <p class="black">- <b>Transfer:</b> you may request that we transfer your personal data to you or a third party. We will provide to you, or a third 
                        party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Please note that this right only applies 
                        to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p> 
                     <p class="black">- Rectification: you may request rectification of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any 
                        incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p> 
                     <p class="black">- Erasure: you may request erasure of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove 
                        personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your 
                        personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your 
                        information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not 
                        always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time 
                        of your request.</p> 
                     <p class="black">- Object: you may object to how we are processing your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those 
                        of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as 
                        you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data 
                        for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information 
                        which override your rights and freedoms.</p> 
                     <p class="black">- Restriction: you may request that we restrict how we process your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the 
                        processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the 
                        data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it 
                        to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have 
                        overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p> 
                     <p class="black">- Withdrawal of Consent: where we have relied on your consent to process your personal data you will have the right to withdraw 
                        your consent at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you 
                        withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time 
                        you withdraw your consent.</p>
